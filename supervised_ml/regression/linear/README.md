## Linear Regression:
    1. Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 

    Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
    
    2. One variable is considered to be an independent variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
