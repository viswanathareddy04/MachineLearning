## Linear Regression:
    1. Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 

    Y = a + bX, where X is the independent variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
    
    2. One variable is considered to be an independent variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.

    3. Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other (for example, higher SAT scores do not cause higher college grades), but that there is some significant association between the two variables. A scatterplot can be a helpful tool in determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. If there appears to be no association between the proposed explanatory and dependent variables (i.e., the scatterplot does not indicate any increasing or decreasing trends), then fitting a linear regression model to the data probably will not provide a useful model. A valuable numerical measure of association between two variables is the **correlation coefficient**, which is a value between -1 and 1 indicating the strength of the association of the observed data for the two variables

What is Covariance? 

A statistical measure of the **directional relationship** between two variables. positive covariance means the two variables tend to move together. When one variable has a positive value, the other tends to have a positive value as well. If the result were negative, then the two variables would tend to have opposite values.


Finding that two variables have a high or low covariance might not be a useful metric on its own. Covariance can tell how the variables move together, but to determine the strength of the relationship, we need to look at their correlation. The correlation should, therefore, be used in conjunction with the covariance, and is represented by this equation:

What Is the Correlation Coefficient?

The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Its values can range from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of -1 describes a perfect negative, or inverse, correlation, with values in one series rising as those in the other decline, and vice versa. A coefficient of 1 shows a perfect positive correlation, or a direct relationship. A correlation coefficient of 0 means there is no linear relationship.
